    <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
    <p>
      I’m really interested in how large-scale payment systems make decisions under uncertainty.
      Fraud detection isn’t just about predicting risk—it’s about balancing customer experience,
      financial loss, and operational constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project started as a way for me to learn how real payment networks think about risk,
      and it slowly turned into a full decisioning system with explainability and an analyst interface.
    </p>

    <h2>What the System Does</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Scores transactions using behavioral signals</li>
      <li>Selects a decision threshold based on economic tradeoffs</li>
      <li>Explains every high-risk decision using SHAP values</li>
      <li>Generates analyst-friendly summaries using a governed GenAI layer</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      All economic values are computed in local currency units provided by the dataset.
      The goal is to compare decisions consistently, not estimate real-world profit.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>How Decisions Are Made</h2>
    <p>
      Instead of using a fixed probability cutoff, I sweep thresholds and choose the one
      that maximizes net value. This means explicitly modeling:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fraud losses from missed fraud</li>
      <li>Customer friction from false declines</li>
      <li>Revenue preserved from approved transactions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This helped me understand how risk teams think beyond accuracy metrics.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Project Scope</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a simulation of a production‑style payment risk system.
        It’s designed to explore architecture, decisioning, and explainability —
        not to serve as a live or deployed product.
    </p>
    <p>
        All monetary values are expressed in local currency units provided by the dataset,
        and no geographic or exchange‑rate assumptions are made.
    </p>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Explainability & GenAI (Privacy-First)</h2>
    <p>
      In the payments industry, customer data cannot simply be sent to public AI APIs.
      To solve this, I integrated a <strong>local, air-gapped LLM (Llama 3.1)</strong> via Ollama.
    </p>
    <p>
      The AI never makes decisions—it only translates the mathematical SHAP drivers into
      human-readable analyst summaries. Strict guardrails ensure the model never hallucinates
      unverified data, and every generation logs its latency and compliance status for full auditability.

      Below is a short demo showing how an analyst would review a high-risk transaction,
      inspect explainability, and generate an AI-assisted summary.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I’m a data science student who’s especially interested in payments, risk systems,
        and how machine learning is used in real operational settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy working on projects that sit between modeling and product — where technical
        decisions have real tradeoffs and constraints. This project reflects how I like to learn:
        by building systems end‑to‑end and thinking about how they would actually be used.
